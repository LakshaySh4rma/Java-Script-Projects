# Stone Paper Scissors Game
The Stone Paper Scissors Game is a simple yet engaging project that replicates the classic hand game, also known as Rock Paper Scissors. The game allows two players (or one player against the computer) to choose between three options: Stone, Paper, or Scissors. Each option has a specific interaction rule: Stone crushes Scissors, Scissors cut Paper, and Paper covers Stone. The game is designed to determine the winner based on these rules, providing a fun and interactive way to practice programming logic, user input handling, and control structures.
